  For almost as long as I can remember I was fascinated by the game of chess. It all started
  with an assembly during the start of my second grade year. These were exciting times for me
  because I was always thrilled to get out of the classroom for any reason. This assembly will
  always stick out in my mind as more memorable than any other assembly I ever had. It was for
  an after school chess club, and there was a man giving a demonstration about what chess is and
  the basic rules of the game. I was absolutely captivated. I thought it was the best game I had ever
  seen. Somehow my peers did not seem as interested as I was. I joined the club, learned the rules
  of the game and by the end of the school year I took third place in my first chess tournament. I
  still have the trophy to this day.<br><br></p>
  <p class="bio__text">It wasn’t until high school that my chess game started to get more serious. Before then I
  only had casual games with my friends. I would always beat them, so naturally I thought that I
  could beat just about anyone at chess. In high school I got my real dose of competition, and a
  sobering view of where I stood. There were kids from other schools who were so much better
  than I was. They beat me with ease and talked about the game in a way I didn’t understand. I was
  the 1 st board from my school, and when we competed with other schools we didn’t come close to
  winning. This was during my freshman year, and it was during this time that I learned about a
  really strong local chess club in town where the strongest adults play.<br></p>
  <p class="bio__text">All throughout sophomore year I played at the strongest chess club in Las Vegas every
  Friday night. And every night I lost my game. These were long games where you have a lot of
  time to think, about 2 hours each on the clock. Sometimes my games would last the full 4 hours,
  and it was grueling to lose a game after that much time and effort. But by the end of the year,
  something had finally clicked. After many losses, and picking up the lessons from those losses
  
  by analyzing the games with my opponent, something new started to happen. I started winning.
  And I picked up several rating points, moving up the ranks very quickly! This chess club is
  known today as the Las Vegas Chess Center, and we still have games on Friday nights.<br></p>
  <p class="bio__text">During my senior year of high school I had formed a close group of friends who were all
  as enthusiastic about chess as I was. We played almost every day at lunch, and our chess club
  became the strongest chess team out of all the high schools in Las Vegas. We blew away all of
  the competition. It was the year 2012 when Shadow Ridge high school won the state chess
  championship, beating A-Tech by just half a point! I will always cherish these fond memories,
  and to this day my love of chess is as strong as ever. Now I am happy to be a part of the UNLV
  chess club and I hope we build new memories together, and maybe even take it to our
  competitors!</p></div>
