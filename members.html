  For almost as long as I can remember I was fascinated by the game of chess. It all started
  with an assembly during the start of my second grade year. These were exciting times for me
  because I was always thrilled to get out of the classroom for any reason. This assembly will
  always stick out in my mind as more memorable than any other assembly I ever had. It was for
  an after school chess club, and there was a man giving a demonstration about what chess is and
  the basic rules of the game. I was absolutely captivated. I thought it was the best game I had ever
  seen. Somehow my peers did not seem as interested as I was. I joined the club, learned the rules
  of the game and by the end of the school year I took third place in my first chess tournament. I
  still have the trophy to this day. <span id ="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>
  It wasn’t until high school that my chess game started to get more serious. Before then I
  only had casual games with my friends. I would always beat them, so naturally I thought that I
  could beat just about anyone at chess. In high school I got my real dose of competition, and a
  sobering view of where I stood. There were kids from other schools who were so much better
  than I was. They beat me with ease and talked about the game in a way I didn’t understand. I was
  the 1 st board from my school, and when we competed with other schools we didn’t come close to
  winning. This was during my freshman year, and it was during this time that I learned about a
  really strong local chess club in town where the strongest adults play.<br><br>
  All throughout sophomore year I played at the strongest chess club in Las Vegas every
  Friday night. And every night I lost my game. These were long games where you have a lot of
  time to think, about 2 hours each on the clock. Sometimes my games would last the full 4 hours,
  and it was grueling to lose a game after that much time and effort. But by the end of the year,
  something had finally clicked. After many losses, and picking up the lessons from those losses
  
  by analyzing the games with my opponent, something new started to happen. I started winning.
  And I picked up several rating points, moving up the ranks very quickly! This chess club is
  known today as the Las Vegas Chess Center, and we still have games on Friday nights.<br><br>
  During my senior year of high school I had formed a close group of friends who were all
  as enthusiastic about chess as I was. We played almost every day at lunch, and our chess club
  became the strongest chess team out of all the high schools in Las Vegas. We blew away all of
  the competition. It was the year 2012 when Shadow Ridge high school won the state chess
  championship, beating A-Tech by just half a point! I will always cherish these fond memories,
  and to this day my love of chess is as strong as ever. Now I am happy to be a part of the UNLV
  chess club and I hope we build new memories together, and maybe even take it to our
  competitors!</span></p><button onclick="readMore()" id="readMoreBtn">Read More</button></div>
  
  <div class ="bio"><img src="IMG_5508.jpeg"><p class="bio__title"><b>John Tovar</b><br>Vice President</br></p>
    <p class="bio__text">My name is John Tovar, business major and vice president of the UNLV chess club. I learned how to play chess at a young age and while that attraction fizzled out, 
      I became more interested in high school. After I outgrew my friends in skill level, I decided to try to bring attention to my high school chess club. 
      I was the captain of the Silverado High School chess team and led our school in my senior year with a season score of 7-2. 
      I also have experience teaching children and beginners how to play chess at various youth chess clubs. 
      Nowadays I’m still an avid online player and participate in local tournaments when I get the chance. 
      I consider myself to have an aggressive and intuitive play style that is meant to challenge the opponent to a contest of who can calculate deeper. 
      I prefer blitz and bullet time controls, though I also enjoy a nice classical game. Feel free to message me any time at tovarj2@unlv.nevada.edu for a game online!</div></p></div>
  
      <div class ="bio"><img src="IMG_7817.JPG"><p class="bio__title"><b>Kevin Reyes Melendez</b><br>President</br></p>
    <p class="bio__text"> Hello my name is Kevin Reyes, the president of the club. I was taught at a young age how to play chess, but never had anyone 
      who knew how to play. When I first learned the game, I knew I was extremely interested but had no one that had the same passion. 
      I ended up forgetting about it until the last year of high school when my best friend challenged me to a chess match. 
      Whoever won that match would receive $20. I easily won, but then my friend became obsessed with chess and ended up beating me the next day. 
      This gave me an incentive to start studying the game. As I studied the game I started learning more about it and how beautiful it was. 
      It was on that day that I knew I wanted to pursue something with chess.</p></div>

    <p class="bio__text"> My name is Andre Reyes, I am the creator of this website. I started playing chess in my second year of college, and I have been hooked ever since. When Kevin asked me to help make this website, I could not resist!
      To give more detail, I was a complete novice before I was shown the game by some friends of mine, right before summer break. During that summer, I studied and studied, hoping to be competitive with my friends. When school started up the following
    semester, my friends and I saw that Cameron, the founder, was inviting people to join his chess club! The rest is history. </p></div>
